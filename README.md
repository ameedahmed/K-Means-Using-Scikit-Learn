The business case for this scenario is as follows: We are currently negotiating with a prospective fish supplier who has offered us competitive pricing on their seafood products, contingent upon our commitment to purchase in larger quantities. Our objective is to augment fish sales at our retail locations by strategically marketing to our existing meat product consumers. The goal is to encourage a dietary shift towards seafood while ensuring minimal cannibalization of our current meat sales.
